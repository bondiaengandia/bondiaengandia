## Gandia - a place to enjoy

Gandia, nestled on Spain’s Valencian coast about an hour south of Valencia, blends golden beaches with a richly layered history. Its modern heart beats along the extensive Playa de Gandia, a Blue Flag stretch known for soft sand, broad promenades, and a lively Mediterranean atmosphere. Just inland, the old town reveals quieter streets, local markets, and traditional cafés, giving visitors an easy rhythm between seaside leisure and everyday Valencian life.

History here runs deep, most famously through the legacy of the Borgia (Borja) family. The Ducal Palace of Gandia is the standout monument—an elegant complex where Gothic foundations meet Renaissance flourishes, and where Saint Francis Borgia left a lasting cultural imprint. Wandering its courtyards and ornate halls offers a vivid sense of the town’s former ducal prestige and the political currents that once flowed through this corner of the Iberian Peninsula.
Gandia is equally celebrated for its cuisine, especially the fideuà, a local seafood dish akin to paella but made with short noodles instead of rice. Born on fishing boats off the nearby port of Grau de Gandia, fideuà has become a culinary emblem, honored in local competitions and served in eateries across town. Add in fresh seafood, orchard produce, and regional wines, and you have a distinctly Mediterranean table shaped by sea, river, and huerta.

Nature frames the city in subtly dramatic ways. The Serpis River slips by Gandia on its way to the sea, while the nearby Marjal wetlands shelter birdlife and reflect the sky in reeds and shallow lagoons. To the west, the Mondúver massif offers hiking and viewpoints that trade the beach horizon for limestone peaks and valleys, reminding visitors how compactly varied this landscape is.
With reliable sun, a well-connected rail link to Valencia, and a calendar that spans beach season, fall festivals, and springtime blooms, Gandia is appealing year-round. Whether you come for a relaxed week by the water, a day of art and architecture, or a deep dive into Valencian flavors, the city’s mix of coast, culture, and countryside makes it feel both easygoing and unexpectedly rich.
